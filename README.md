# 🧠 HashCode

HashCode is an experimental AI-driven observability and root-cause analysis engine designed to help developers and operations teams move beyond “what went wrong” to **why it happened** — and how to fix it.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Modern distributed systems generate massive telemetry data (logs, traces, metrics). Traditional tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** visualize these signals, but they often fail to pinpoint the actual cause of system failures.

**HashCode** fills that gap by:
- Ingesting observability data
- Building a causal graph of relationships between metrics and services
- Using AI/graph-based reasoning to detect anomalies and predict failures
- Providing explainable recommendations for resolution

## 🧩 Core Features

- **Causal Graph Engine** – Learns relationships between system components  
- **Root Cause Detection** – Identifies the origin of cascading failures  
- **Anomaly Detection** – Detects early warning signs from time-series data  
- **Visualization Layer** – Integrates with Grafana and Prometheus for live dashboards  
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Optimizer** – Continuously improves decision-making
